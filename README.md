People need to know the truth about whats going on (time4popcorn / popcorn time)


### Nice quote of Sharkiller

```
Time4Popcorn is a bad clone, they use the official github to stole progress.

They are not active neither the "widely-known" of the current development. 

As you can see here https://github.com/popcorn-official/popcorn-app/issues?state=open we have a lot of issues 
reported, here the actively repo 

https://github.com/popcorn-official/popcorn-app/commits/dev-0.3
that is taken by time4popcorn. 

Their repo is a clone of ours with no issues, no commits, same UI we were working for the past weeks.

You can see people here talking about the garbage of this clone and not recommending to install
(official stickied post on reddit) 

http://www.reddit.com/r/PopCornTime/comments/232xmf/a_list_of_popcorn_time_clones_and_android/ time4popcorn is neither the first and neither the one that publish build. 

As you can see their mac build is the SAME as our official from http://get-popcorn.com and github. RIDICULOUS (they don't know how to compile :))
