				<h1>Official Announcement</h1>
				<p>I have great news regarding the future of Popcorn Time.</p>
				<p>
					As you may know, when the original Popcorn Time team decided they had reached their objectives, Popcorn Time development had been chaotic at best.
					First there was the word that YTS would continue to lead the project, but they retracted later.
					After that, the project was taken in quick succession by jduncanator and isra17 who subsequently both chose to retire from the project for unpublicized reasons.
				</p>
				<p>
					We stepped up, in order to stabilize the project by providing resources needed and by continuing the development.
					We are now a team of 20 active developers ( 5 working on the UI ) coming from all over the world, and we are the most active Popcorn Time Community.
					We are totally aware of the legal implications, and we're not afraid, because we care for the people.
					We are in for the long run, and we're proud to continue Popcorn Time as it was first conceived.
				</p>
				<p>
					We want to make the best Popcorn Time, that's why we invite everyone to participate in the project.
					To make sure every voice can be heard, we have the following channels open.
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>a blog: <a href='http://blog.get-popcorn.com' target='_blank'>http://blog.get-popcorn.com</a></li>
					<li>a forum: <a href='http://discuss.get-popcorn.com' target='_blank'>http://discuss.get-popcorn.com</a> (discussions about the current work, questions, feature, suggestions, FAQ,...)</li>
					<li>a Uservoice: <a href='https://popcorntime.uservoice.com' target='_blank'>https://popcorntime.uservoice.com</a></li>
					<li>an IRC channel #popcorntime on freenode. <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=popcorntime" target='_blank'>Web access</a> (developers are hanging around most of the time ;) )</li>
					<li>a Twitter account: <a href='http://twitter.com/popcorntimetv' target='_blank'>http://twitter.com/popcorntimetv</a></li>
					<li>a Github repository: <a href='https://github.com/popcorn-official/' target='_blank'>https://github.com/popcorn-official/</a></li>
					<li>a Facebook page is coming soon.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					We are excited to say that Popcorn Time 0.3 is around the corner, and we'll be able to announce a release date in the next days.
					It will support what the community asked more, TV series support. And fortunately, it's only one of several improvements.
					These last weeks, we layed the groundwork for a tailored user experience (Bookmarks, watchlist,...), an improved interface and performance tweaks.
				</p>
				<p>We are also committed to make Popcorn Time available on most platforms and Popcorn Time for Android is in the pipeline!</p>
				<p>
					As part of the community, we are really looking forward to the future.
					We will make sure Popcorn Time keeps its roots by providing the right mix between features and simplicity by design, with the help of the community.
				</p>
				<p>This is only the beginning.</p>
				<p>
					PS: On a sidenote, and as Torrent Freak has written about them, I must point that Time4Popcorn are pretending to be developing another version of Popcorn Time. The truth is that they are ripping some of our community work without crediting the authors. We would obviously have no concerns if they acknowledged the source of the work, as Popcorn Time is an open source project. The latest example being how they compiled in their app 5 days of our UI work.
